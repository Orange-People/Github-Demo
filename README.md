   cd github-deep-dive
   ```

2. **Open in your browser**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html
   # or
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000

   - Practice with the Git command simulator

## üìñ GitHub Concepts

### Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to:
- Track modifications to your code
- Revert to previous versions
- Compare changes between versions
- Collaborate with team members

### Git vs GitHub
- **Git**: A distributed version control system (the tool)
- **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories (the service)

### Key Concepts

#### Repository (Repo)
A repository is a storage location for your project files and their complete history.

#### Commit
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, with a unique identifier (hash).

#### Branch
A branch is a parallel version of your project, allowing you to work on features without affecting the main codebase.

#### Pull Request (PR)
A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository, allowing for code review and discussion.

#### Issues
Issues are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other project tasks.

## üéÆ Interactive Demo

The interactive demo section provides hands-on experience with GitHub features:

### Live Repository View
- **Commits Tab**: See a timeline of project changes
- **Branches Tab**: View all project branches and their status
- **Issues Tab**: Track project tasks and bugs

### Git Command Simulator
Click on any Git command to see it executed in a simulated terminal:
- `git init` - Initialize a new repository
- `git add` - Stage changes for commit
- `git commit` - Save changes with a message
- `git push` - Upload changes to remote repository

### Visual Workflow
Step-by-step demonstration of the GitHub workflow:
1. Clone repository
2. Create feature branch
3. Make changes and commit
4. Push changes and create pull request

## üìù Git Commands Reference

### Basic Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `git init` | Initialize a new repository | `git init my-project` |
| `git clone` | Clone an existing repository | `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| `git status` | Check repository status | `git status` |
| `git add` | Stage changes | `git add .` or `git add filename` |
| `git commit` | Commit staged changes | `git commit -m "Add new feature"` |

### Branching Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `git branch` | List branches | `git branch` |
| `git checkout` | Switch branches | `git checkout main` |
| `git checkout -b` | Create and switch to new branch | `git checkout -b feature/new-feature` |
| `git merge` | Merge branches | `git merge feature/new-feature` |
| `git branch -d` | Delete branch | `git branch -d feature/old-feature` |

### Remote Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `git push` | Push changes to remote | `git push origin main` |
| `git pull` | Pull changes from remote | `git pull origin main` |
| `git fetch` | Fetch remote changes | `git fetch origin` |
| `git remote` | Manage remote repositories | `git remote -v` |

### Advanced Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `git log` | View commit history | `git log --oneline` |
| `git diff` | Show changes | `git diff HEAD~1` |
| `git reset` | Reset changes | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` |
| `git stash` | Temporarily save changes | `git stash` |

## üèÜ Best Practices

### Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain what and why:

**Good Examples:**
- `Add user authentication with JWT tokens`
- `Fix responsive design issues on mobile devices`
- `Update API documentation for new endpoints`

**Bad Examples:**
- `Fix stuff`
- `Update`
- `Changes`

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names that indicate the purpose:

**Good Examples:**
- `feature/user-dashboard`
- `bugfix/login-validation`
- `hotfix/security-patch`

**Bad Examples:**
- `new-stuff`
- `fix`
- `test`

### Code Reviews
Always have someone else review your code:
1. Create a pull request
2. Request review from team members
3. Address feedback and suggestions
4. Merge only after approval

### Documentation
Keep your project well-documented:
- Update README.md regularly
- Include setup and installation instructions
- Document API endpoints and functions
- Add inline comments for complex code

## üîß Advanced Topics

### GitHub Actions
Automate workflows with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build
```

### Branch Protection Rules
Protect important branches:
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict pushes to specific users

### GitHub Pages
Host static websites directly from your repository:
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Choose source branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`)
3. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

### Organizations and Teams
Manage multiple repositories and users:
- Create organizations for companies or projects
- Set up teams with specific permissions
- Manage billing and security settings
